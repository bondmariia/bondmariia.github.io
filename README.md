# The face of Great Britain: where do residents come from

The United Kingdom is one of the most diverse countries in the world due to a high level of immigrants continually moving to the island. Almost 10 million people of the British population were born abroad. However, the centres of migration are not homogeneous around the world. The immigration law that varies for countries, as well as the reason to migrate to the UK, create a pattern of origin of immigrants in the United Kingdom.

So far, EU citizens have been free to live and work in the UK as one of the EU member states without the need for a visa. That ensures free movement of labour and job opportunities for those EU citizens who seek a better life. Even though, after three months upon arrival you should prove that you have a job, are a student or can support yourself on your own, this is an opportunity that is widely used by those who want to improve their financial situation. Eastern Europe as the least developed part of the EU is the main flashpoint of immigration to the UK in Europe.

Poland is the leader among all countries in terms of the number of immigrants. Poles have had a long history of immigration to the UK since World War 2 and account for just under 1 million in 2018, which is the largest single nationality from the rest of the EU. Poland’s GDP per capita is significantly lower than Britain’s ($15.4, compared to the UK’s $ 42.6) with the average hourly wage 13$, which is four times less than in Britain. As a result, still, a lot of skilled workers are tempted to move to the UK.

The situation is worse in Romania, the country with the second the most significant number of migrants moving to the UK. When the country joined the EU, it was expected that Romania would grow and develop its economy. However, this country is still stuck with corruption and poverty. According to Eurostat, more than a third of Romanians are at risk of poverty and almost half of the country’s children are borderline poor. Consequently, more than 400 thousand people born in Romania moved to the UK and currently live there.

Close ties link Great Britain with India, Pakistan, Bangladesh as former colonies, which resulted in a long history of immigration. They even created two separate national groups within the UK: Indian British and Pakistani British. Therefore, it is not surprising that the immigrants from those countries are one of the major groups in terms of quantity (862000 Indians and 529000 Pakistani). Most African immigrants come from Nigeria and South Africa, other two former British colonies. Those countries are the most developed in Africa, the access to information for the poor is better than in other African countries, so people get to know about the opportunities and migrate more than from the neighbouring countries. However, the rich and the poor are distributed not equally around the country. The percentage of poor people is big enough to lead to a high rate of migrants.
